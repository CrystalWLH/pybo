## Overview

pybo is a word tokenizer for the Tibetan language entirely written in Python. pybo takes in chuncks of text, and returns lists of words. It provides an easy-to-use, high-performance tokenization pipeline that can be adapted either as a stand-alone solution or compliment.

## Getting Started 

    pip install pybo
    
Or if you for some reason want to install from the latest Master branch:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Esukhia/pybo.git
